# BayesianMMM_PYMC3
create Media Mix Modelling with PYMC3 and use Bayesian to check Marketing channels like media and Control variables

## Description

Media Mix Modeling (MMM) is a technique that employs statistical techniques to evaluate the influence of different advertising mediums within a company's marketing strategy on their return on investment.

Bayesian inference is employed to conduct statistical analysis and determine a probability distribution for each parameter. Bayesian regression can be understood as a blend of three components: prior probability, likelihood, and posterior probability.

For implementation we used PyMC3 that is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and probabilistic machine learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms.
